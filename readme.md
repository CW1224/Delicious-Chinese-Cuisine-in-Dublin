# Jin Li Wang Restaurant and Take-away

Welcome to the readme file of my project.

## Introduction
Chinese culture has been a huge part of my life. Chinese food always makes an appearace on our kitchen table, whether it's in the morning, afternoon or the evening. Even though, I grew up outside of China and have only tasted a limited amount of chinese food, I still want to share my personal experience with you. If you have the chance to visit China, don't forget to try food that isn't on this list;).

You can find a link to my website [here]()

# 1. User Experience

## User Goals

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

My goal in creating a menu for this project is to introduce people to the chinese culture especially the chinese cuisine. Chinese cuisine has been around for at least five thousand years. It has changed a lot over this long period of time but the essence remains the same. So, I wanted to share some of my country's famous dishes with everyone!
## User Expectations

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The website should contain information about the chinese restaurant itself and the food it serves. It should contain descriptions of each dish and hopefully have an image of each dish.

The following are expected of this website:

* Should be easy to use and accessable on all electronic appliances.
* Should be visually appealing and contain the necessary information for the user.
* Should contain the address so that users of the website can locate the restaurant.
* Should contain contact information so that users can ask questions, book in or order food.
* Should be able to apply for a job at the restaraunt online.

## Color Scheme and Font

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
### Colors

The color scheme for this website are light colors. I think that the correct use of color is one of the key elements that attracts users to a website. In my opinion, I think light colors are more gentle on the eye when flicking through a website. I used the rgb color values as the main color inputs in my project.

### Fonts

The way I decided on the font style was using google fonts. I inserted the name "Jin Li Wang" into google fonts and scrolled through the list until I saw the one that was the most suitable. It took a while but eventually I decided on the font below.

I used different font sizes in my project based on the placement of items and pieces of code. The sizing adjusts itself according to the screen size. I think this is important as having a font that is too big on a small iphone screen will definitely decreases a visitor's appeal and opinion of the website.

## Visual Images

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

I used pixabay as my main source of image gathering for my project. I feel like visual context is more appealing to visitors visiting my website since it is a food-based one. This would engage the visitors more and hopefully will attract them to actually book a table and try the dish out. 

Images also add to the quality of a website as it makes it more appealing to the eye by adding colors and shapes rather than words.

## Skeleton Framework

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Invision was used to create the webframe and to brainstorm my ideas. I created four altogether, two for the webpage and two for an iphone screen.

I created three web pages altogether for my website, one for the home page, one for a survey page and one for a recruitment page. My ideas are presented below.

fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
(This showed up on my previous repository and I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. I tried to change the setting and inserting new commands but this always shows up when I enter one. I created this new repository and copied and pasted everything from my previous repository to this one. Therefore all the commits I've made on this repository are from the same time. Also, in the beginning of this project I forgot to commit, I just saved everything I've done and continued on where I left off. I would start commiting from now on. All I've done in my previous file is the HTMl part of my project. I'm going to start my CSS part now. [11/07/2022 22:21])
