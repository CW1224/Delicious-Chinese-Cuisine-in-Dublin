# Jin Li Wang Restaurant and Take-away

Welcome to the readme file of my project.

## Introduction
Chinese culture has been a huge part of my life. Chinese food always makes an appearace on our kitchen table, whether it's in the morning, afternoon or the evening. Even though, I grew up outside of China and have only tasted a limited amount of chinese food, I still want to share my personal experience with you. If you have the chance to visit China, don't forget to try food that isn't on this list;).

You can find a link to my website [here]()

# User Experience

## User Goals

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

My goal in creating a menu for this project is to introduce people to the chinese culture especially the chinese cuisine. Chinese cuisine has been around for at least five thousand years. It has changed a lot over this long period of time but the essence remains the same. So, I wanted to share some of my country's famous dishes with everyone!
## User Expectations

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The website should contain information about the chinese restaurant itself and the food it serves. It should contain descriptions of each dish and hopefully have an image of each dish.

The following are expected of this website:

* Should be easy to use and accessable on all electronic appliances.
* Should be visually appealing and contain the necessary information for the user.
* Should contain the address so that users of the website can locate the restaurant.
* Should contain contact information so that users can ask questions, book in or order food.
* Should be able to apply for a job at the restaraunt online.
## Color Scheme and Font

[Return to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
### Colors

The color scheme for this website are light colors. In my opinion, I think light colors are more gentle on the eye when flicking through a website. But if I want something to stand out I would put in a bold color that matches the overall website. 

### Fonts

The way I decided on the font style was using google fonts. I inserted the name "Jin Li Wang" into google fonts and scrolled through the list until I saw the one that was the most suitable. It took a while but eventually I decided on the font below.

fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
(This showed up on my previous repository and I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. I tried to change the setting and inserting new commands but this always shows up when I enter one. I created this new repository and copied and pasted everything from my previous repository to this one. Therefore all the commits I've made on this repository are from the same time. Also, in the beginning of this project I forgot to commit, I just saved everything I've done and continued on where I left off. I would start commiting from now on. All I've done in my previous file is the HTMl part of my project. I'm going to start my CSS part now. [11/07/2022 22:21])
