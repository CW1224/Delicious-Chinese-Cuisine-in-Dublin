fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
(This showed up on my previous repository and I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. I tried to change the setting and inserting new commands but this always shows up when I enter one. I created this new repository and copied and pasted everything from my previous repository to this one. Therefore all the commits I've made on this repository are from the same time. Also, in the beginning of this project I forgot to commit, I just saved everything I've done and continued on where I left off. I would start commiting from now on. All I've done in my previous file is the HTMl part of my project. I'm going to start my CSS part now. [11/07/2022 22:21])
